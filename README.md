# DontLeave

My project.

## What is it?

Basically, when you go somewhere, you can log that you are leaving your items (you could log each by name, or all together, your choice) and it will save the location of your items. Basically, it's Airtags, but only software - no hardware - and y'know **not 54 bucks** a pop, it's ***FREE***!

## State

The main point is that I get this in a working state, good enough to ship basically, but once I've done that, I will likely ship extra updates with more polishing etc. I have one or two features that I do plan to incorporate in the [roadmap](https://github.com/orangetreefrog4/dontleave/blob/main/README.md#roadmap).

## Roadmap

<div id="roadmap">

0 - To ship the first release.

  |

1 - To make it more of an "app"-like interface.

  |

2 - Maybe make notifications.

  |

3+ - TBD.
